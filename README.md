# Pet-Ranker


This is a fun little app that lets you decide which animal picture is cuter by comparing two images side by side. Every time you vote, the app uses the Elo rating system to update each animal's score, so the leader board keeps changing as you vote more. Adding images is super easy: you can drag and drop them straight into the app, or pick them through a file dialog. The app even copies them into its own "project_images" folder so nothing breaks if you move or delete the original files.

The interface is simple: two pictures, buttons to vote, dislike, or mark a draw, and a status bar that tells you what's happening. You can look at bigger versions of the images in a built-in viewer that lets you zoom, rotate, and inspect them properly. There's also a gallery mode, a detailed match history, and a full leaderboard showing which animals are currently ruling the cuteness charts. You can save your whole session, load it later, or export the leaderboard as a CSV file. Overall, this application mixes GUI, images, and a cool rating system into something that's actually fun to use and perfect for a project or personal.
